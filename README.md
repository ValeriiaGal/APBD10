To run the project, provide the following connection string in `appsettings.json`:
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "UniversityDatabase": "YourConnectionStringHere"
  }
}

Why I decided to split the code into several projects:
1.To show that each project has its own purpose, different from others
2. To make the code better orginized
3. So that the code will be easier to read and update
4. Make it easier to improve and expand the code in the future
5. The code is built and loaded faster
